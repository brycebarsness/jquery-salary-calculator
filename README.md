# Dunder Mifflin Monthly Expense Audit

## Processing Annual Salary Total by Employee For Budget Total per Month

_Duration: One week(end)

This application recieves employee information, including annual salary, then compiles the monthly salary total for each employee entered. If over budget, the user is alerted by a pop-up indicating the amount over budget. The Monthly Payroll total remains red while over-budget, returning to normal formatting when the total drops back with-in budget. 

There are five inputs for employee information at the top of the screen (under the heading: 'Add Employee'). They include: employee first name, last name, id, title, and annual salary. To submit the information entered, and add it to the table below (titled: 'Employees'), the unser clicks on the 'Submit' button to the right of the 'Add Employee' input section. The employee information will now be displayed in the 'Employee' section. Below the talble, the 'Monthly Payroll Calculator(MPC)' will also be updated. Here the user will find the sum of the monthly average of each employee entered above. 

To remove an employee from the 'Employee' section the user clicks on the 'Delete' button on the far right side of the coresponding row belonging to the employee to be discarded. Upon removal of an employee entry, the monthly average of that employee's annual salary will be removed from the MPC. Upon entering an employee which brings the the MPC above budget($20,000.00), an alert will appear on the screen. The alert will indicate the total amount the MPC is over budget. To return to the main screen the user clicks 'OK'. The MPC will now have a red background color to indicate its status as over budget. The user is able to continue adding employees while over budget. The MPC will continue to have a red background until the average drops below budget.
